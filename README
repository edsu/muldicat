This is a simple conversion tool to make the Multilingual Dictionary of 
Cataloging Terms and Concepts (MulDiCat) available as SKOS. MulDiCat is 
currently made available as a table in a Word document. Ideally there would 
be software managing the MulDiCat namespace, which allowed edits, and provided
an audit trail. This conversion script is meant to only be used as a
bootstrappnig mechanism to demonstrate the use of SKOS.

Follow these steps to convert the Word document into RDF/XML.

1. Open the Word document in Open Office
2. Create a new spreadsheet: File -> New -> Spreadsheet
3. Select the table: Table -> Select -> Table
4. Copy the table: Edit -> Copy
5. Paste the table into the first cell of the spreadsheet: Edit -> Paste
6. Save as CSV: File -> Save As -> Set File Type: Text CSV

Once you've got the CSV file in hand you should be able to generate the RDF/XML
with the following command:

  rdfize Muldicat.csv > Muldicat.rdf

Requirements:

- python
- rdflib
